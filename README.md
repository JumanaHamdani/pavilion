# Northen Light Pavilion


## Description

An interactive web-based application to envision a piece of contemporary urban infrastructure made of ice blocks that would activate the areas around northern cities in Sweden.The starting point of this experimental pavilion is based on the quarter-circular truchet pattern generating in-between maze-like curvature spaces, controlled by width, length, and pattern.


## Plugins

Only native components.

## Instructions
- First you need to run Rihno.compute
- Go to the App page in this link:https://jumanahamdani.github.io/pavilion/
- Change the Inputs: **Width, and  lengths** of the pavilion, then you can input the pattern of the pavilion in the **seed value** based on your aesthtic preferences.
- The OutPuts would be the Geometry of the ice pavilion, where you can download

## Data Flow

The configurator is created using Rhino and Grasshopper3d with native components,with inputs to deciede both the size and the pattern of the pavilion. The result geomentry is created using mesh gradient colors.
