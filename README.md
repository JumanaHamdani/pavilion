# Northen Light Pavilion


## Description

An interactive web-based application to envision a piece of contemporary urban infrastructure that would activate an alleyway in the city’s core.The starting point of this experimental passageway pavilion is based on the quarter-circular truchet pattern generating in-between maze-like curvature spaces, controlled by width, length, height, and pattern.


## Plugins

Only native components.

## Instructions
- Inputs: **Width, lengths, height** of the passageway, then we can input the pattern of the pavilion in the **seed value**
- OutPuts: Geometry of the passageway pavilion

## Data Flow

The configurator is created using Rhino and Grasshopper3d with native components,with inputs to deciede both the size and the pattern of the passageway. The result geomentry is created using mesh gradient colors.

The site is published using a Heroku app called "Pavilion".
